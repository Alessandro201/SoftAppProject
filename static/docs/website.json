If the data is None, it's likely that the cache has exceeded the timout defined in the config.py. You need to reload the page to compute again the table\n3) Extract from \"data_to_save\" which is a dictionary the rows and the labels of the table\n4) A csv.writer is instantiated. It needs StringIO\n5) Write as the first row the labels of the columns, then write all the rows\n6) Make a response which allows the .tsv file to be downloaded\n7) Set some information of the file that will be downloaded like its name and filetype.",
